# JetB-Code-Sharing-Platform
JetBrains : my next project

To get acquainted with server development on Spring Boot and touch on some basic topics in Web-programming such as HTML, CSS, and JS.
The program shows the same code snippet over and over in the API and the web interface.
It uses POST requests to update the snippet and displays the time of the most recent update.
The program uses the template engine FreeMarker to easily implement the latest snippets feed.
The application uses a database to store all the code snippets and implements a few access restrictions for the top-secret code snippets.
